# Network Drain Cleaner

Work in progress network debugging mod for modded minecraft. Only affects dedicated server <-> client connections at the moment, (so not singleplayer) . Must be installed on both ends to work - and this breaks networking completely if either end is missing it.

(description coming soon).
